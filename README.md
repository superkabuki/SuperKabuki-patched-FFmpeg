# FFmpeg with the SuperKabuki SCTE-35 patch applied.
## Ever get this message when transcoding a SCTE-35 stream?

![412188557-af4e4bba-3612-4709-9660-48e485b2df9e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0f8ab8a-2e0d-4229-b867-a093bdf4f0c4)

##  __The SuperKabuki patch stops that from happening.__

* The patch  allows you copy a SCTE-35 stream over as SCTE-35, when you're encoding with ffmpeg.
* The patch also adds the SCTE-35 Descriptor __(CUEI / 0x49455543)__ , just to be fancy.
* Everything else works just like unpatched ffmpeg.

###  [The patch adds only seven lines of code](https://github.com/superkabuki/FFmpeg_SCTE35/blob/master/superkabuki-scte35.patch)  to two files, libavformat/mpegts.c and libavformat/mpegtsenc.c.
* The rest of the commits come from FFmpeg, I just keep the repo with them.

## Install  

in five easy steps.


1.    `git clone https://github.com/superkabuki/FFmpeg_SCTE35.git`

2.    `cd FFmpeg_SCTE35`

3.    `./configure --enable-shared --extra-version=-SuperKabuki-patch` 
 
      you can customize configure as needed. <br>
      There are a lot of ffmpeg configure options available. <br>
      __The superkabuki patch doesn't require any special configure options.__
      
  

4.    `make all` 

  On OpenBSD use `gmake` instead of `make`.

5.    `sudo make install`

## How to use:

Use it just like unpatched FFmpeg.

# Examples

### 1.  Re-encode video to h.265, audio to aac, copy over the SCTE-35, and keep the timestamps.

* I build my ffmpeg with libx265 enabled. `--enable-libx265 --enable-nonfree`
```smalltalk
ffmpeg -copyts -i input.ts -map 0  -c:v libx265 -c:a aac -c:d copy -muxpreload 0 -muxdelay 0 output.ts
```

### 2. Copy all streams including SCTE-35, cut the first 200 seconds, and keep the timestamps.


```smalltalk
ffmpeg -copyts -ss 200 -i input.ts -map 0  -c copy -muxpreload 0 -muxdelay 0 output.ts
```
